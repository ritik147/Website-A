  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

        The journey of travelling make the things easy to understand around
        every moment of your life

    <p id="script">The journey is tough so there are places where travelers may rest. Some are free of cost whereas some take toll. Punctual arrive there on time as planned but some who might have met with troubles in their way might not. But their spirits to get to the destiny makes them push hard and not rest so they reach in good times.</p>
